## 🎯 Finding What You Need

### "I want to..."

- **...get started** → [Getting Started](tutorials/getting-started.md)
- **...understand the architecture** → [Architecture](explanation/architecture.md)
- **...add a new feature** → Check [API Mapping](reference/api-mapping.md), then see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) section 0.2
- **...check implementation status** → [Roadmap](development/roadmap.md)
- **...run tests** → [Testing Guide](development/testing.md)
- **...understand CRDTs** → [Automerge Guide](ai-agents/automerge-guide.md)

### By Technology

## 📝 Documentation Methodology

We use the **Diátaxis framework** to keep documentation organized:

```
                LEARNING-ORIENTED | GOAL-ORIENTED
                ------------------+---------------
    PRACTICAL   TUTORIALS         | HOW-TO GUIDES
                ------------------+---------------
    THEORETICAL EXPLANATION       | REFERENCE
```

### Rules

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Each piece of info lives in ONE place only
2. **Name by Purpose** - Files named for what they're FOR, not what they contain
3. **Root Level = Critical** - Only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in repo root
4. **Use Links** - Reference, don't duplicate

### For AI Agents

If you're an AI agent (Claude Code, etc.):

1. Start with [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) - Master instructions
2. Read [Automerge Guide](ai-agents/automerge-guide.md) - Understand CRDTs
3. Check [API Mapping](reference/api-mapping.md) - Know what's implemented
4. Follow [Architecture](explanation/architecture.md) - Understand the layers
