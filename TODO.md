# TODO - Automerge WASI Demo

## Current State

✅ **Working:** Basic collaborative text editor
- Rust WASI module wraps Automerge
- Go server with wazero hosts WASM
- SSE broadcasts text changes to all tabs
- Single shared `doc.am` on server

❌ **NOT Implemented:** True Automerge sync protocol

## The Problem

**Current demo is NOT using Automerge correctly!**

- All clients edit ONE shared document on the server
- Uses whole-text replacement (POST full text)
- NOT using Automerge's sync protocol (deltas)
- Each "laptop" should have its own `doc.am` and sync changes

## What is a `doc.am` file?

**`doc.am` is a binary snapshot file** that contains the entire state and history of an Automerge CRDT document.

### Key Concepts:

**1. Not Just Current State**
- It doesn't just store "Hello World" (the current text)
- It stores **every single edit** that was ever made to the document
- Example: "H" added, then "e", then "llo", then someone deleted "l", etc.

**2. Binary Format**
- The `.am` extension stands for "**Automerge**"
- It's a compact binary format (not human-readable text)
- Contains the full operation history compressed efficiently

**3. CRDT Magic - Conflict-Free Merging**

When you have two different `doc.am` files that diverged:
```
Laptop A's doc.am: "Hello World" (edited offline)
Laptop B's doc.am: "Hello Everyone" (edited offline)
```

Automerge can **merge them without conflicts** because each file contains:
- Which character was inserted when
- Who inserted it (which replica/user)
- The causal order of all operations

**4. Inside a `doc.am` file (simplified):**
```
[Header]
ActorID: user-123
Operations: [
  { op: "insert", pos: 0, char: "H", timestamp: 1000, actor: user-123 }
  { op: "insert", pos: 1, char: "e", timestamp: 1001, actor: user-123 }
  { op: "insert", pos: 2, char: "l", timestamp: 1050, actor: user-456 }
  { op: "delete", pos: 2, timestamp: 1100, actor: user-123 }
  ...
]
```

### Current Demo vs. Real Automerge

**What the current demo does WRONG:**
```
Server has: doc.am (ONE shared file)
Client 1 → POST "Hello World" → overwrites doc.am
Client 2 → POST "Hello Everyone" → overwrites doc.am  ❌ LOST DATA!
```

**What real Automerge should do:**
```
Laptop A has: doc_A.am (Alice's personal copy)
Laptop B has: doc_B.am (Bob's personal copy)
Server has: doc_server.am (server's copy)

Alice edits offline → doc_A.am grows with new operations
Bob edits offline → doc_B.am grows with new operations

When they connect:
- Alice syncs → Server merges doc_A.am + doc_server.am = new doc_server.am
- Bob syncs → Server merges doc_B.am + doc_server.am = final doc_server.am
- Both get the merged result ✅ NO DATA LOSS!
```

### Why Sync Deltas (Not Full Files)?

Sending entire `doc.am` files every edit would be:
- ❌ Huge bandwidth (file grows with every edit ever made)
- ❌ Slow performance

Instead, Automerge syncs **deltas** (just new operations):
- ✅ "I added 5 characters at position 10"
- ✅ Minimal bandwidth
- ✅ Fast real-time sync

## What Automerge SHOULD Do

### Real Architecture:
```
Laptop A                 Laptop B
  doc.am                   doc.am
    |                        |
    | Sync deltas            |
    | (just changes)         |
    └────────┬───────────────┘
             |
        NATS/WebSocket
```

### Current (Wrong) Architecture:
```
Browser Tab A    Browser Tab B
      |                |
      └────► Server ◄──┘
          ONE doc.am
```

## Proper Data Modeling (Critical!)

### Current Demo Uses Wrong Automerge API

**Current (WRONG) approach:**
```rust
// lib.rs - Using string replacement
doc.put(&automerge::ROOT, "text", "whole string value")  // ❌
```

**Should use Automerge.Text type:**
```rust
// Create a Text object for collaborative editing
let text_id = doc.put_object(&automerge::ROOT, "text", ObjType::Text)?;
// Then insert/delete individual characters
doc.splice_text(&text_id, 0, 0, "Hello")?;
```

### Why This Matters

- **Text type**: Character-level CRDT that merges concurrent edits properly
- **String replacement**: Just overwrites, NO conflict resolution
- Without `Automerge.Text`, we're not using Automerge's core functionality!

### Document Structure

Automerge documents are JSON-like:
```json
{
  "text": <Automerge.Text object>,  // NOT a plain string!
  "metadata": {
    "title": "My Document",         // Immutable strings OK here
    "lastModified": 1234567890
  }
}
```

## TODO List

### Phase 0: Fix Data Model (BLOCKING!)
- [ ] **Replace string-based text with Automerge.Text type**
  - [ ] Update Rust lib.rs: `doc.put_object(ROOT, "text", ObjType::Text)` (returns ObjId)
  - [ ] Store text ObjId in thread-local state (needed for all text operations)
  - [ ] Replace `am_set_text()` with `am_text_splice(pos, del_count, insert_str, len)`
  - [ ] Update `am_get_text()` to read from Text object using stored ObjId
  - [ ] Add helper: `am_text_len()` to get current text length
- [ ] **Update Go server to call am_text_splice instead of am_set_text**
  - [ ] Parse incoming text changes to determine pos, delete, insert
  - [ ] Or: Use `updateText` pattern (diff old vs new, generate splices)
- [ ] **Test character-level operations work correctly**
  - [ ] Insert at position 0, middle, end
  - [ ] Delete characters
  - [ ] Verify Text CRDT properties (not plain string in doc.save())
- [ ] **Verify merge works with concurrent text edits**
  - [ ] Create two docs, both edit text, merge them
  - [ ] Should NOT lose either edit (list merge rules)

### Phase 1: Document Current State
- [ ] Add section to README explaining this is a simplified demo
- [ ] Note that true Automerge sync is NOT implemented
- [ ] Reference CLAUDE.md Milestone M1 for full sync implementation

### Phase 2: Implement Automerge Sync Protocol (M1)

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:** Sync is **per-peer**, not per-document!
- Multiple clients can sync THE SAME document
- Each peer needs its own SyncState for every other peer
- Server tracks: `map[peerId]map[documentId]*SyncState`

#### Rust WASI Module
- [ ] **Sync State Management**
  - [ ] Add `am_sync_state_new(peer_id_ptr, len) -> u32` - Create sync state for peer
  - [ ] Store sync states: `map[peer_id]*SyncState`
- [ ] **Generate Sync Messages**
  - [ ] Add `am_sync_gen(peer_id_ptr, len) -> i32` - Generate message for specific peer
  - [ ] Add `am_sync_gen_len() -> u32` - Get message length
  - [ ] Add `am_sync_gen_read(ptr_out) -> i32` - Read generated message
- [ ] **Receive Sync Messages**
  - [ ] Add `am_sync_recv(peer_id_ptr, id_len, msg_ptr, msg_len) -> i32`
  - [ ] Apply changes from peer's sync message
  - [ ] May trigger need to generate response message
- [ ] **Storage Operations (See AGENT_AUTOMERGE.md Storage Model)**
  - [ ] Implement storage key format: `[docId, type, identifier]`
  - [ ] Save incremental changes: `[docId, "incremental", hash]`
  - [ ] Save snapshots: `[docId, "snapshot", heads]`
  - [ ] Add `am_compact()` - Compact incremental changes to snapshot

#### Go Server
- [ ] **Per-Peer Sync State Management**
  - [ ] Create `SyncManager` with `map[peerId]map[docId]*SyncState`
  - [ ] Assign unique peer ID to each connected client (UUID)
  - [ ] Initialize sync state when client connects to a document
- [ ] **Replace HTTP Text API with Sync Protocol**
  - [ ] Change POST /api/text to POST /api/sync (binary sync messages)
  - [ ] SSE /api/stream sends sync messages (not JSON text updates)
  - [ ] On client edit: receive sync message, apply via `am_sync_recv`, generate responses
- [ ] **Storage Backend**
  - [ ] Implement storage adapter (filesystem or in-memory for now)
  - [ ] Store with key format: `data/[docId]/[type]/[identifier].am`
  - [ ] Load all chunks on startup: `loadRange([docId])`
  - [ ] Periodic compaction (combine incrementals → snapshot)
- [ ] **Document Sharing Architecture**
  - [ ] Single document can have multiple clients syncing
  - [ ] Each client has own sync state with server
  - [ ] Server maintains one doc.am, syncs with all clients

#### UI
- [ ] Replace POST /api/text with Automerge sync message exchange
- [ ] Send local edits as sync deltas
- [ ] Apply received sync deltas to local document
- [ ] Keep local Automerge state (not just textarea)

### Phase 3: Multi-Document Support (M2)
- [ ] Support multiple documents via `?doc=<id>` query param
- [ ] Add `am_select(doc_id)` / `am_new_doc(doc_id)` to Rust
- [ ] Store snapshots per document: `data/<docId>.am`

### Phase 4: User Presence & Identity
**Feature:** Know who's connected and identify users

- [ ] **User Identity System**
  - [ ] Add user registration/login (or anonymous with persistent ID)
  - [ ] Assign unique user ID + display name
  - [ ] Store user preferences (color, avatar)
- [ ] **Presence Tracking**
  - [ ] Track connected users per document
  - [ ] Detect user joins/leaves (WebSocket connect/disconnect)
  - [ ] Broadcast presence updates via SSE
- [ ] **UI: User List**
  - [ ] Show list of connected users in sidebar
  - [ ] Display user color/avatar/name
  - [ ] Show online/offline status

### Phase 5: Cursor Position Sharing
**Feature:** See where others are editing

- [ ] **Cursor Position Protocol**
  - [ ] Add cursor position message type (separate from sync)
  - [ ] Send cursor position on selection change
  - [ ] Throttle cursor updates (max 10/sec to reduce bandwidth)
- [ ] **Ephemeral Data Channel**
  - [ ] Cursor positions are NOT stored in doc.am (ephemeral!)
  - [ ] Use separate SSE channel or message type
  - [ ] Clear cursor when user disconnects
- [ ] **UI: Remote Cursors**
  - [ ] Display remote cursor positions in textarea
  - [ ] Color-code cursors by user
  - [ ] Show user name tooltip on hover

### Phase 6: Real-Time Keystroke Sync
**Feature:** Instant character-by-character updates

- [ ] **Remove Save Button**
  - [ ] Sync on every keystroke (oninput event)
  - [ ] Use `am_text_splice` for character-level edits
  - [ ] Throttle/debounce if needed (but prefer immediate)
- [ ] **Typing Indicators**
  - [ ] Broadcast "typing" status when user types
  - [ ] Show "User X is typing..." indicator
  - [ ] Clear indicator after 2 seconds of inactivity
- [ ] **Optimistic UI Updates**
  - [ ] Apply local edits immediately (don't wait for server)
  - [ ] Update cursor positions after remote edits
  - [ ] Handle cursor position adjustments (insertions shift positions)

### Phase 7: Conflict Detection & Visualization
**Feature:** Show when concurrent edits conflict

- [ ] **Detect Conflicts**
  - [ ] Use `Automerge.getConflicts()` to detect concurrent property updates
  - [ ] Track which edits came from which user
  - [ ] Identify overlapping edit regions
- [ ] **Conflict UI**
  - [ ] Highlight text regions with conflicts
  - [ ] Show tooltip: "Alice and Bob both edited here"
  - [ ] Indicate which value "won" (LWW based on operation ID)
  - [ ] Option to view/accept alternate values

### Phase 8: Offline Support
**Feature:** Work without network, sync when reconnected

- [ ] **Browser-Side Persistence**
  - [ ] Store doc.am in IndexedDB (see AGENT_AUTOMERGE.md Storage Model)
  - [ ] Save incremental changes locally while offline
  - [ ] Load from IndexedDB on page reload
- [ ] **Reconnection Logic**
  - [ ] Detect network disconnect/reconnect
  - [ ] Queue sync messages while offline
  - [ ] Resume sync when connection restored
  - [ ] Show offline indicator in UI
- [ ] **Merge on Reconnect**
  - [ ] Send accumulated local changes as sync messages
  - [ ] Receive remote changes made while offline
  - [ ] CRDT merge handles everything automatically!

### Phase 9: NATS Transport (M3)
**Feature:** Replace HTTP with scalable pub/sub

- [ ] Replace HTTP SSE with NATS subjects: `automerge.sync.<tenant>.<docId>`
- [ ] Store snapshots in NATS Object Store
- [ ] Add RBAC via JWT
- [ ] Support multi-tenancy

### Phase 10: Testing & Performance
- [ ] Test with two separate processes (simulating two laptops)
- [ ] Verify offline edits merge correctly when reconnected
- [ ] Test conflict resolution (both edit same line)
- [ ] Add automated tests

## Why This Matters

**Automerge is designed for:**
- Offline-first applications
- Conflict-free merging of concurrent edits
- Peer-to-peer sync without central server
- Minimal bandwidth (only sync deltas, not full state)

**Current demo just shows:**
- The tech stack works (Rust WASI + Go + wazero)
- Basic SSE broadcasting
- NOT the real power of Automerge!
